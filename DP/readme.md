# Dynamic Programming

Dynamic Programming is a method used in mathematics and computer science to solve complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems. By solving each subproblem only once and storing the results, it avoids redundant computations, leading to more efficient solutions for a wide range of problems. This article provides a detailed exploration of dynamic programming concepts, illustrated with examples.

### The two common dynamic programming approaches are:

- Memoization: Known as the “top-down” dynamic programming, usually the problem is solved in the direction of the main problem to the base cases.
- Tabulation: Known as the “bottom-up '' dynamic programming, usually the problem is solved in the direction of solving the base cases to the main problem
